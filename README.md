# Make-bookmark-directory-of-PDF
This is some python code for crafting bookmark directory for PDFs. At first, you need to prepare a .txt file containing the table of content of the PDF and ToC.ipynb is used to pre-operate the file and produce a new .txt file, which is then used by PDF.ipynb file to add the bookmark directory to the specified PDF. An example is uploaded for clearer demonstration.
